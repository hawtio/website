:fn-hawtio-enabled: pass:c,q[footnote:hawtio-enabled[Containers with a configured port named `jolokia` and that exposes the https://jolokia.org[Jolokia] API.]]

https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio-online[Hawtio Online] is a Hawtio console that eases the discovery and management of _hawtio-enabled_ {fn-hawtio-enabled} applications deployed on OpenShift.

== Preparation

Prior to the deployment, depending on the cluster types you need to generate either of the _proxying_ or _serving_ certificates.

[cols="1,5"]
|===
|Certificate |Description

|_Proxying_
|Used to secure the communication between Hawtio Online and the Jolokia agents. A client certificate is generated and mounted into the Hawtio Online pod with a secret, to be used for TLS client authentication.

|_Serving_
|Used to secure the communication between the client and Hawtio Online.
|===

=== Proxying certificates

For OpenShift, a client certificate must be generated using the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html[service signing certificate] authority private key.

Run the following script to generate and set up a client certificate for Hawtio Online:

[source,console]
----
$ ./scripts/generate-proxying.sh
----

or if you have Yarn installed, this will also do the same thing:

[source,console]
----
$ yarn gen:proxying
----

=== Serving certificates

For OpenShift, a serving certificate is automatically generated for your Hawtio Online deployment using the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html[service signing certificate] feature.

== Deployment

Now you can run the following instructions to deploy the Hawtio Online console on your OpenShift cluster.

There are two deployment modes you can choose from: **cluster** and **namespace**.

[cols="1,5"]
|===
|Deployment Mode |Description

|Cluster
|The Hawtio Online console can discover and connect to _hawtio-enabled_ {fn-hawtio-enabled} applications deployed across multiple namespaces / projects. +
**OpenShift:** Use an OAuth client that requires the `cluster-admin` role to be created. By default, this requires the generation of a client certificate, signed with the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html[service signing certificate] authority, prior to the deployment. See the <<Preparation>> section for more information.

|Namespace
|This restricts the Hawtio Online console access to a single namespace / project, and as such acts as a single tenant deployment. +
**OpenShift:** Use a service account as OAuth client, which only requires `admin` role in a project to be created. By default, this requires the generation of a client certificate, signed with the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html[service signing certificate] authority, prior to the deployment. See the <<Preparation>> section for more information.

You may want to read how to https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[get started with the CLI] for more information about the `oc` client tool.

To deploy the Hawtio Online console on OpenShift, follow the steps below.

=== Cluster mode

If you have Yarn installed:

[source,console]
----
$ yarn deploy:openshift:cluster
----

otherwise (two commands):

[source,console]
----
$ oc apply -k deploy/openshift/cluster/
$ ./deploy/openshift/cluster/oauthclient.sh
----

=== Namespace mode

If you have Yarn installed:

[source,console]
----
$ yarn deploy:openshift:namespace
----

otherwise:

[source,console]
----
$ oc apply -k deploy/openshift/namespace/
----

You can obtain the status of your deployment, by running:

[source,console]
----
$ oc status
In project hawtio on server https://192.168.64.12:8443

https://hawtio-online-hawtio.192.168.64.12.nip.io (reencrypt) (svc/hawtio-online)
  deployment/hawtio-online deploys hawtio/online:latest
    deployment #1 deployed 2 minutes ago - 1 pod

Open the route URL displayed above from your Web browser to access the Hawtio Online console.

== Authentication

Hawtio Online currently supports authentication mode `oauth` for OpenShift, which is configured through `HAWTIO_ONLINE_AUTH` environment variable on Deployment.

[cols="1,5"]
|===
|Mode | Description

|`oauth`
|Authenticates requests through https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/authentication/understanding-authentication.html[OpenShift OAuth server]. It is available only on OpenShift.
